## Why This One?

There are more and more Markdown tools out there, each packed with features — real-time collaboration, cloud sync, plugin ecosystems... But most of the time, you just want to **quickly open a .md file and read it quietly**.

Markdown Reader is built for exactly that:

- **Zero friction** — No sign-up, no login, no complex configuration. Just open and read
- **Instant launch** — Native macOS app. Fast startup, fast switching, smooth reading
- **Focused on reading** — Three-pane layout: file tree + rendered view + outline navigation. See document structure at a glance
- **Tiny and lightweight** — DMG installer under 10MB, takes minimal space

When you don't need writing, collaboration, or fancy features — just want to **quickly view a Markdown document** — this is the right choice.
